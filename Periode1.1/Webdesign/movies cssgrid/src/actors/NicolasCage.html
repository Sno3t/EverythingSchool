                Name: Nicolas Cage <br>
                Date of birth: 1-7-1964 <br>
                Place of birth: Long Beach, California, United States <br><br>


                Nicolas Cage was born Nicolas Kim Coppola in Long Beach, California, the son of comparative literature
                professor August Coppola (whose brother is director Francis Ford Coppola) and dancer/choreographer Joy
                Vogelsang. He is of Italian (father) and Polish and German (mother) descent. Cage changed his name early
                in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by
                the late 1980s.<br><br>

                Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High School (though he dropped out at seventeen), he secured
                a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and
                leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a
                movie career. But a job reading lines with actors auditioning for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983)
                landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released
                first and truly launched his career.<br><br>
