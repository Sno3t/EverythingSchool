            <h1>Astro Boy</h1>
            <p> Description: <br>
                In the 22nd century, Toby Tenma is a teenager who lives in the futuristic city-state of Metro City,
                which floats above the polluted surface on Earth. His father, Dr. Tenma, works at the Ministry of
                Science, alongside Dr. Elefun. They create the Peacekeeper, an advanced defensive robot that is powered
                using two powerful energy spheres that emit respective opposing positive and negative energy,
                respectively in colors blue and red from a star fragment discovered by Dr. Elefun. The two scientists
                brief the President of Metro City, Stone, who is running for re-election. Against the scientists'
                warnings, Stone loads the negative red colored core into the Peacekeeper, causing it to go on a rampage.
                Toby is accidentally killed by the Peacekeeper, as it attempts to violently leave the research facility
                before it is put down by Dr. Elefun. <br><br>

                A distraught-driven Tenma revives Toby as a robot programmed with all his memories, but also makes his
                body with built-in defenses to protect him. Powered by the positive blue colored core, the robot
                activates and believes himself to be Toby, but although he has his original brain and a similar
                personality, Tenma realizes he could never be revived as the son he lost. Toby discovers his new robot
                capabilities including the ability to understand non-talking robots and rocket-powered flight. Stone has
                his forces pursue Toby, but the chase leads to him falling off the city's edge when Stone's flagship
                blasts him with missiles. Meanwhile, Tenma escapes arrest by agreeing to disable Toby and give up the
                blue core. <br>

            <div id="myDIV" style="display:none">
                Toby awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots of Metro City it dumped there.
                He meets a group of orphaned children, Zane, Sludge, Widget, and Cora, accompanied by a dog-like robot
                named Trashcan. Toby also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx, Robotsky, and
                Mike the Fridge, who plan to free robots from mankind's control, but are very inept and bound by the
                Laws of Robotics. While attempting to recruit him for their cause, they rename Toby "Astro". Hamegg, the
                caretaker of the orphans, takes Astro in. The next day, Astro comes across an old, offline construction
                robot named Zog, whom he reactivates through sharing some of the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg scans Astro,
                discovering he is actually a robot, and paralyzes Astro with his electrical-blaster to use him in the
                fighting ring. <br><br>

                Astro reluctantly defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog gets deployed. Astro and Zog refuse to fight and
                Hamegg attempts to disable both of them, but Zog, who predates the Laws of Robotics, fights back. Zog
                nearly kills Hamegg but gets saved by Astro, shocking the crowd. Moments later, Stone's forces arrive to
                take Astro back to Metro City, and he willingly surrenders himself. Astro reunites with Tenma and Elefun
                and allows them to disable him. Realizing even though Astro is not Toby, he is still his son, Dr. Tenma
                defies Stone, reactivates Astro, and lets him escape. Outraged, Stone reloads the Red Core into the
                Peacekeeper to send it after Astro, only for it to absorb and merge with him. The Peacekeeper absorbs
                weapons and buildings, becoming bigger and stronger, and attacks Metro City, prompting Astro to battle
                it. Metro City's power station gets destroyed during the fight, causing the city to fall, and Astro uses
                his superhuman strength to help it land safely. <br><br>

                The Peacekeeper tries absorbing Astro to get his Blue Core using the Red Core, but the cores' connection
                causes a violent reaction and separates them. Dr. Tenma tells Astro that the two cores united will
                destroy themselves. The Peacekeeper captures Astro's friends from the junkyard, and he flies into the
                Red Core, sacrificing himself to destroy it, while Stone survives its destruction and gets arrested for
                his actions. As Elefun and the children find Astro's body, Zog reactivates Astro by sharing back the
                Blue Core energy that reactivated him, and Astro reunites with all his friends and his father. The city
                is later attacked by a monstrous cycloptic extraterrestrial, but Astro punches it as he leaps into
                action. <br>
