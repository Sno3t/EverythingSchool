                <p> Description: <br>
                    Space Jam: A New Legacy (also known as Space Jam 2) is a 2021 American live-action/animated sports
                    comedy film produced by Warner Animation Group and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film was
                    directed by Malcolm D. Lee from a screenplay by Juel Taylor, Tony Rettenmaier, Keenan Coogler, Terence
                    Nance, Jesse Gordon and Celeste Ballard.[8] It serves as a standalone sequel to Space Jam (1996) and is
                    the first theatrically released film to feature the Looney Tunes characters since Looney Tunes: Back in
                    Action (2003). The film stars basketball player LeBron James as a fictional version of himself; Don
                    Cheadle, Khris Davis, Sonequa Martin-Green, and Cedric Joe star in live-action roles, while Jeff
                    Bergman, Eric Bauza, and Zendaya headline the Looney Tunes voice cast. The film follows James enlisting
                    the Looney Tunes' aid to win a basketball game in a Warner Bros.-themed virtual multiverse against a
                    rogue artificial intelligence's avatars after James's son is abducted by the AI.

                    Discussions for a Space Jam successor began following its release. Director Joe Pytka was attached to
                    return in that capacity and Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone signed on as the animation directors; however,
                    the project was stalled due to Michael Jordan's refusal to return. Several possible spin-offs focusing
                    on other athletes, including Jeff Gordon, Tiger Woods, and Tony Hawk, were also discussed but never
                    materialized. After several years in development, a LeBron James-led sequel was officially announced in
                    2014 with filming under Nance taking place from June to September 2019 around Los Angeles. After several
                    weeks into filming, Nance left the project in July 2019 and was replaced by Lee.
                    <br>
                    Premiering in Los Angeles on July 12, Space Jam: A New Legacy was released nationwide in the United
                    States by Warner Bros. Pictures on July 16, 2021, and through HBO Max for one month. The film was a box
                    office disappointment, grossing $163 million worldwide against a production budget of $150 million, and
                    received generally negative reviews from critics for its script, humor, and runtime; and particularly
                    for its extensive product placement of Warner Bros. properties.[9] It won three of its four Golden
                    Raspberry Award nominations, including Worst Actor for James.
